# Drilling-mechanism
Design, CAD models, and supporting resources for a drilling mechanism — including 3D assemblies, images, simulations, and documentation.

This repository contains the design, CAD models, and supporting resources for a **mechanical drilling mechanism**. The project is organized for collaboration across design, simulation, and documentation teams.

## 🛠️ Components

### 1. **Drill Bit (`my drill 3.SLDPRT`)**
- The cutting tool that performs the drilling operation.
- Designed for efficient penetration into material.
- Geometry optimized for torque transmission.

### 2. **Drill Covering (`my drill covering 1.SLDPRT`)**
- Protective casing around the drill.
- Ensures user safety and structural rigidity.
- Prevents debris from interfering with moving parts.

### 3. **Drill Support (`my drill support 1.SLDPRT`)**
- Provides axial and radial support to the rotating drill.
- Reduces vibration and improves accuracy.
- Acts as the interface with the frame/fixture.

### 4. **Rotating Storage (`my rotating storage.SLDPRT`)**
- A rotating holder or chuck that transmits torque from the motor/drive shaft to the drill bit.
- Allows easy attachment and replacement of drill bits.
- Can store rotational kinetic energy for smoother operation.

### 5. **Assemblies**
- **`iris.SLDASM`**  
  Likely represents a subassembly (possibly iris-like mechanism for controlling drill engagement or clamping).  
- **`my assembly drilling 2.SLDASM`**  
  Full assembly combining drill, support, covering, and rotating storage into a functional drilling unit.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The drilling mechanism operates in the following sequence:

1. **Torque Input**  
   - A motor or manual drive transmits torque to the **rotating storage** (chuck-like component).  

2. **Power Transmission**  
   - The torque is transferred from the rotating storage to the **drill bit**.  
   - The **support structure** ensures the drill bit remains aligned and stable.  

3. **Cutting Operation**  
   - The **drill bit** penetrates the work material, removing material in the form of chips.  

4. **Safety & Protection**  
   - The **covering** encloses critical components, protecting the mechanism and operator.  

5. **Assembly Integration**  
   - The assemblies (`iris.SLDASM`, `my assembly drilling 2.SLDASM`) integrate all components into a complete, functional drilling unit.
